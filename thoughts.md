ntro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design.

1. I like that the website takes into consideration whether or not if I am currently viewing it in a full screen or half sized, so if I view the page in full screen there will be a side bar of contents showing but there is a button to also display that content if I'm at a smaller screen size

2. It's user friendly and displays content to exactly what you need

3. The search bar is easy to locate and expands when clicked on

4. I don't like the search results because the text color sort of blends into the background

5. The documentation is not beginner friendly, it jumps back and forth between the whole page about situations

6. The API guides and the references are on different pages so it's easy to get lost
